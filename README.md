# Homework-6
This is a readme file for a weather aplication. This is a weather application created with html, javascript, css, jquery, and bootstrap css.
This app also used an api from Openweather. To make this weather app work, two api calls were used, one to geolocate a city and another to pull actual weather data for the user to see after user interaction. Data like temp, uv index, wind speed and an icon for weather are dynacilly appended to html with javascript. A five day forecast is also appended to the page. Uv index is also dynamiclly changed to show colors matching offical uv indexes.
